        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Rafting World made its first commercial trip on December 12, 1993 on the San Juan River, but its story begins many years before, when Augusto Caballero and José Cabrera met at the I.N.E.F. MENDOZA, taking the exam for Physical Education teachers.

            The passion for the river and outdoor life brought them together. They began working in a rafting company in Potrerillos, they traveled to the United States and upon their return they created their own company in the province of San Juan. At first they only had 3 rafts and equipment for 18 passengers. 
            Some time later they moved to the place where it all began, Potrerillos, Mendoza. Their first base of operations was at the A.C.A Camping facilities, in a small space that the Pola family, concessionaire of the place, gave them. They set up a tent for 3 summer seasons and did not stop until they were able 
            to build their first cabin in front of the campsite, on the banks of the Mendoza River, which was their base of operations for 10 years. With the construction of the Potrerillos Dam, the area was under water and they had to move to the site where the base now operates, which was inaugurated in November 2006 
            and currently has equipment for more than a hundred people in the rafting activity, fifty equipment corresponding to canopy and rappel, about twenty-five mountain bikes and kayaks to serve groups of both companies and student schools.</p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>For the adventurer, we offer year-round rafting trips on a class III+ river. All our excursions are on the Mendoza River, before the Potrerillos Dam.

            Constant rapids provide action throughout the descent. In summer, with its greatest flow, the Mendoza River drags sediments and forms holes and waves making rapids of high intensity. In winter the flow decreases and allows you to appreciate the rocks that are part of the nature of the place.
           
            The trips are led by our internationally experienced guides who have International Whitewater Rescue Certification and are accompanied by safety kayakers. All participants are equipped with life jackets (PFD), neoprene suits, waterproof jackets, neoprene booties and a helmet. We have top of the line equipment. We use Hyside Hypalon 14 foot self-evacuating boats.</p>
